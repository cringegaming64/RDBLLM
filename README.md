Title: Diffusion-Based Language Models: Leveraging Reverse Diffusion for Text Generation and Denoising

Authors: [Your Name]

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing text generation and denoising using reverse diffusion processes within a transformer-based architecture. We introduce a Diffusion-Based Language Model (DBLM), which utilizes the GPT-2 transformer model as a backbone and applies a denoising technique inspired by reverse diffusion to improve generated sequences. Unlike traditional autoregressive models, which generate tokens sequentially, DBLM operates in an embedding space, adding noise and progressively denoising it. This approach offers new insights into the use of diffusion processes in natural language processing (NLP).

1. Introduction: Language models (LMs), particularly transformer-based architectures like GPT-2, have achieved significant success in text generation, text completion, and various NLP tasks. However, the standard autoregressive approach often struggles with long-term coherence and can suffer from issues such as repetitive text generation. To address these limitations, we explore a novel denoising-based approach where text generation is framed as a reverse diffusion problem. By perturbing the model's embeddings with noise and denoising them through a learned model, we hypothesize that it is possible to generate more coherent and contextually accurate text sequences.

2. Related Work: Autoregressive language models such as GPT-2 [1] and GPT-3 [2] have set benchmarks for language generation, but they often face challenges related to repetitive patterns, lack of coherence over long texts, and non-optimal token sampling strategies [3]. Diffusion models have been widely used in image generation [4] and have recently made their way into NLP tasks as well [5]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply reverse diffusion techniques in text generation using transformer models.

3. Methodology: Our approach extends GPT-2 with a denoising mechanism inspired by reverse diffusion processes. The primary contributions are:

Noisy Embeddings: Instead of directly operating on token sequences, we inject noise into the embeddings of text sequences. This creates a noisy version of the text that the model must denoise.

Reverse Diffusion Process: Given noisy embeddings, the DBLM model applies a reverse diffusion step, progressively denoising the embeddings through a learned process. This step enhances the model's ability to reconstruct coherent text sequences.

Diffusion Schedule: The model uses a simple Gaussian noise schedule that injects noise of varying magnitudes at each step of the reverse diffusion process. This procedure is aimed at finding the optimal denoised embeddings that correspond to meaningful text.

4. Model Architecture: The DBLM architecture is based on GPT-2, with some modifications to accommodate the denoising process. The core components are as follows:

Transformer Backbone: We use GPT-2's pre-trained transformer model as the backbone for embedding extraction and sequence generation. The transformer layers are kept intact, but the model‚Äôs embedding layer receives perturbed input embeddings.

Noisy Embeddings Generation: Given an input text, the model‚Äôs embedding layer generates a corresponding set of embeddings, which are then corrupted by Gaussian noise.

Denoising via Reverse Diffusion: The noisy embeddings are passed through a reverse diffusion process to progressively recover clean, meaningful embeddings, which are then mapped back to token sequences.

Objective Function: The model is trained using the mean squared error (MSE) loss between the denoised embeddings and the original clean embeddings. This loss guides the model to learn the denoising procedure and generate improved text sequences.

5. Experimental Setup: We evaluate our method on a small set of textual data consisting of short sentences. The DBLM is trained using a basic training loop where noisy embeddings are generated at each step, followed by reverse diffusion for denoising. The following experiments were conducted:

Training Data: A small dataset consisting of sentences like "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away..." and "In the middle of the night..." was used for training.

Training Procedure: The model was trained for 100 steps using Adam optimization with a learning rate of

1e‚àí5. The training procedure involves adding noise to the embeddings, performing reverse diffusion to denoise them, and optimizing the denoising objective.

6. Results: Sample text generations from the model exhibit varying levels of coherence and creativity. For example, given the prompt "so as i was saying," the model generates sequences like "the time first" or "the the to." These results demonstrate that the model can create output with reasonable coherence but still suffers from occasional repetition.

Additionally, when given a prompt like "generate me a story," the output was typically "the the," which indicates that the denoising process is still in development. Further optimization of the reverse diffusion process is required for better text quality.

7. Novelty and Contributions: The primary novelty of this approach lies in the integration of reverse diffusion with transformer-based models. While autoregressive models like GPT-2 have shown success in generating text, DBLM offers a unique perspective by treating text generation as a reverse diffusion process, where noisy embeddings are progressively denoised to generate text.

However, it is important to note that the concept of denoising in a reverse diffusion process itself is not entirely new, as it has been applied to other domains such as image generation. The application of this technique to text generation is what sets our work apart, though further refinements and more extensive evaluation are required.

8. Limitations:

Coherence: While the model produces plausible sequences, the coherence over long passages is still limited compared to autoregressive models.
Noise Handling: The Gaussian noise schedule used in this work is simple, and more sophisticated noise schedules may yield better results.
Training Efficiency: The model requires substantial computation and training time, particularly for more complex text corpora.
9. Conclusion and Future Work: We presented the Diffusion-Based Language Model (DBLM), which introduces a novel reverse diffusion mechanism to enhance text generation. While preliminary results show promise, further work is needed to refine the reverse diffusion process, improve text coherence, and evaluate the model on more complex datasets. Future directions may include incorporating more advanced noise schedules, optimizing training efficiency, and exploring other diffusion models for NLP tasks.
